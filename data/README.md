## Breast Cancer Datasets

In the mitosis_detection folder, the datasets were created from 

- an Aperio XT scanner (scanner A)
- a Hamamtsu NanoZoomer scanner (scanner H)

Scanner A has a resolution of 0.2456 µm per pixel. Scanner H has a slightly better resolution of 0.2273 µm
(horizontal) and 0.22753 µm (vertical) per pixel, so a pixel of scanner H is not exactly a square. 

For example, a mitosis having an area of 30 µm2 will cover about 500 pixels of the image
produced by scanner A, about 580 pixels of the image produced by scanner H

The pathologists have annotated mitosis manually. They made the annotations in each selected HPF on the
images generated by the scanner A, the scanner H.
