### Project: Automating Explainability in Healthcare

Medical patients have a legally protected “right to explain” regarding decisions
made about their medical care. The “black box” prediction nature of ML models
doesn’t adhere to such Explainability leaving patients less likely to trust decisions
made based on a ML algorithm. By incorporating Explainable AI (XAI) techniques in
medical ML diagnostic applications, the patients’ rights remain protected while
helping care providers explain the diagnosis provided.
