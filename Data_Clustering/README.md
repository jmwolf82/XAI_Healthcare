## Clustering Notebooks

These notebooks have begun the investigation on clustering confirmed Mitotic Figures into different categories. Mitotic Figures go through various phases, and the idea is to try to group the found figures by the respective phase. Interphase -> Early Prophase -> Late Prophase -> Metaphase -> Anaphase -> Telophase -> Cytokinesis
