## MITOS Datasets

Each dataset has been replicated from 21 different WSI that have been associated to the appropriate Sqlite annotation database. The Datasets have been split into 'train' and 'test' folders. The split is that 7 WSIs worth of annotations are made into the 'test' folders while the other 14 WSIs worth of annotations are in the 'train' folders.
